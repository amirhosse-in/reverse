# Project Proposal: Reverse (Reverse Engineering Learning Platform)

## Project Overview

The Reverse is an educational web application that fosters a collaborative environment for users to submit problems and solutions, primarily focusing on reverse engineering challenges. This project will utilize Django on the server side and React on the client side to provide a robust and user-friendly experience. The primary goal is to create a dynamic and secure platform where users can both contribute challenges and provide solutions, with administrative functions for oversight.

## Features

The Reverse will include the following key features:

1. **Database Connectivity**: The platform will connect to a secure and reliable database system to store user contributions, problems, solutions, and comments while ensuring data integrity.

2. **User Roles with Varied Permissions**: The system will support multiple user roles, distinguishing between contributors and administrators. Contributors can submit problems, solutions, and comments. Administrators will have the authority to accept, reject, or manage user contributions and maintain the integrity of the platform.

3. **Local Configuration Settings**: Users will be able to personalize their interaction with the platform by configuring their settings through local variables. This customization may include options for notifications, user interface preferences, and accessibility features.

4. **RESTful API Compliance**: The project will follow REST principles for designing efficient and standardized interactions between the client and server components to ensure smooth communication.

5. **Coding Standards (Minimized Coupling and Maximized Cohesion)**: The project will adhere to coding standards that promote low coupling and high cohesion for an organized and maintainable codebase, allowing for future enhancements.

6. **Project Purpose and Goals**: The primary purpose of this project is to create a secure and collaborative platform where users can contribute reverse engineering problems, solutions, and engage in discussions. Key goals include:

   - Enabling users to submit a wide range of reverse engineering problems and solutions.
   - Fostering an interactive learning community through user-contributed content and discussions.
   - Ensuring the security and privacy of user data.
   - Promoting best practices in coding and reverse engineering.
   - Facilitating ethical behavior and adherence to legal boundaries in reverse engineering.

## Technology Stack

The Reverse will be developed using the following technologies:

- **Server-Side Framework**: Django
- **Client-Side Framework**: React
- **Database System**: PostgreSQL
- **API Standard**: RESTful API
- **Version Control**: Git
