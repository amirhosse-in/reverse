# Project Name: Django-React-Docker-DevOps

## Overview
This project aims to provide a simple example of a Django backend with a React frontend, containerized using Docker. The integration of Django and React allows for a full-stack web application development environment, and Docker simplifies the deployment process by containerizing the application.

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose installed on your machine: [Docker Compose Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Basic understanding of Django and React

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/django-react-docker-devops.git
cd django-react-docker-devops
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will build the Docker images for both the Django backend and React frontend, and then start the containers.
